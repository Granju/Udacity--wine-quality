# Project Name
This project is related to my first data science blog post, written as part of my Udacity data science nanodegree education. The blog post can be found [here](https://medium.com/@julienflandre/can-robots-be-sommeliers-cf8134302680). The project consists in analysing data about red and white Vinho Verde wines and building a machine learning algorithm to class wines by quality level.

## General Information
This repository contains the two original csv files used for the analysis and the Jupyter Notebook with the code to follow along the process.

I start by stacking the two datasets into one by adding a style column to differentiate the red and white wines. I then run some exploratory data analysis to get familiar with the dataset. 

## Technologies Used
Python 3.9.7
